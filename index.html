      <h2>Linguistics in the Netherlands</h2>
      <p>It may sound weird to choose to study Linguistics (or languages in general) in the Netherlands. After all, it is a small country with a population of under 18 million people and a national language with only about 30 million speakers (that is, less than one third of the number of Vietnamese speakers). So, why should one study there instead of UK, US, or any other Anglophone countries, or France, where they could study more useful language?</p>
      <p>But there are two things to realize: one is that the Dutch people are actually really, really good at learning languages. According to <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f551bd64-8615-4781-9be1-c592217dad83">a survey by the EU</a>, about three out of four Dutch people have practically skills in at least two foreign languages. The second point is that Linguistics is not just about learning one or two languages, but learning about how to approach languages scientifically. The intriguing questions that we may ask are: what are the building blocks of a language? How can we try to describe and understand them? How can a child learn them? How do they change over a person's lifetime and over the centuries? And many other topics.</p>
      <p>In this scientific subject that we call Linguistics, the Netherlands is really excelling compared to its size. According to the <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-subject-rankings/linguistics?countries=nl&sort_by=rank&order_by=asc">2023 QS Subject Ranking for Linguistics</a>, they have four universities in top 100 and three of them are in top 50. Beyond the metrics, the works on Linguistics that was done in the Netherlands also have a global impact on the development of linguistics all over the world. Therefore, the Netherlands is actually quite a good country to study Linguistics in. </p>

      <h2>And taught in English</h2>
      <p>However, the bachelors in the Netherlands still predominently have a Dutch language requirement, due to the restriction of the government. Fortunately, there are three universities that offer a bachelor's program in Linguistics: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="uni/ams.html">University of Amsterdam</a></li>
        <li>Leiden University</li>
        <li>Utrecht University</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Overview about them</h2>
      <p>In generaly, the three programs have a typical structure of a Dutch BA degree: it takes 180 ECTS to complete, of which 30 ECTS are free-choice credits, and concluded by a BA thesis.Free-choice credits may seem like a foreign concept to some countries, but they are quite common in Europe.</p>
