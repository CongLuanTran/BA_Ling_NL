      <h2>Linguistics in the Netherlands</h2>
      <p>It may sound weird to choose to study Linguistics (or languages in general) in the Netherlands. After all, it
        is a small country with a population of under 18 million people and a national language with only about 30
        million speakers (that is, less than one third of the number of Vietnamese speakers). So, why should one study
        there instead of UK, US, or any other Anglophone countries, or France, where they could study more useful
        language?</p>
      <p>But there are two things to realize: one is that the Dutch people are actually really, really good at learning
        languages. According to <a
          href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f551bd64-8615-4781-9be1-c592217dad83">a survey
          by the EU</a>, about three out of four Dutch people have practically skills in at least two foreign languages.
        The second point is that Linguistics is not just about learning one or two languages, but learning about how to
        approach languages scientifically. The intriguing questions that we may ask are: what are the building blocks of
        a language? How can we try to describe and understand them? How can a child learn them? How do they change over
        a person's lifetime and over the centuries? And many other topics.</p>
      <p>In this scientific subject that we call Linguistics, the Netherlands is really excelling compared to its size.
        According to the <a
          href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-subject-rankings/linguistics?countries=nl&sort_by=rank&order_by=asc">2023
          QS Subject Ranking for Linguistics</a>, they have four universities in top 100 and three of them are in top
        50. Beyond the metrics, the works on Linguistics that was done in the Netherlands also have a global impact on
        the development of linguistics all over the world. Therefore, the Netherlands is actually quite a good country
        to study Linguistics in. </p>

      <h2>And taught in English</h2>
      <p>However, the bachelors in the Netherlands still predominently have a Dutch language requirement, due to the
        restriction of the government. Fortunately, there are three universities that offer a bachelor's program in
        Linguistics: </p>

      <h2>Overview about them</h2>
      <p>
        In generaly, the three programs have a typical structure of a Dutch BA degree: it takes 180 ECTS to complete, of
        which 30 ECTS are free-choice credits, and concluded by a BA thesis. Typically, people take 30 ECTS per
        semester, two semesters per year. The entire bachelor is thus generally completed in three years. But many
        students in fact take more than three years to complete the bachelor, as they may spend their time exploring, or
        they study part-time, or it takes them longer to go through some parts of the program, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Free-choice credits may seem like a foreign concept to some countries, but they are quite common in Europe. For
        these credits, the student is allowed to choose almost any course that they can fulfil the prerequisites. So, a
        Linguistics student can also take courses in Mathematics, Computer Science or Natural Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        The milestone of a Dutch bachelor program is the thesis. The thesis is an important essay written at the end of
        the bachelor, usually requires about 5000 to 10000 words. In Dutch university, the students are given a lot of
        freedom to choose the topic of their thesis, and the supervisor usually act more as a mentor that can be
        consulted rather than the master directing the student.
